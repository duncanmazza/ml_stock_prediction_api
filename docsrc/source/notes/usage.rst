Usage
=====
The API is interactive, and runs off of a Bokeh server. To run it, open terminal and move to the root of the tool. Then, run the following line::

	bokeh serve --show .

This will open a server on http://localhost:5006/ml_stock_prediction_api. Open this link in your browser to access the API.

Refer to our project's README for more information on running the api:
