LSTM Example:
A model trained for 100 epochs to predict Apple stock with the added features of Microsoft, Google, and Motorola stock produced the output shown below. The results in are generated in training mode; in evaluation mode, the model predicts mostly homogeneous trends between input sequences. Further work is required to mitigate this issue and produce predictions that are more robust.
